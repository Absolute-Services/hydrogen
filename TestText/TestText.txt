All of this text of obviously not code, so why would we want to include it in the code block? Short answer is we don't. There is no need to add this to the code block as it would just confuse everyone. That is why the bot know how to check for code and not-code. The regular text will be re-posted as text while the code block will be formatted appropriately. This should work but I have not tested every possible case. but its the 99% solution.

What if there is a line right above the code? Is this included in the code block? It should not be.
using UnityEngine;

    /// <summary>
    /// Class summary looks like this.
    /// </summary>
    public class MyClass
    {
        /// <summary>   Description of myFloat. </summary>
        private float myFloat;
        /// <summary>   Description of myInt.   </summary>
        private int myInt;

        /// <summary>   Default constructor. </summary>
        public MyClass(float _myFloat, int _myInt)
        {
            /*
                Multi-line comment looks like this.
                With multiple lines of text.
            */
            
            this.myFloat    = _myFloat;
            this.MyInt      = _myInt;
        }
        
                
        /// <summary>   Description of MyInt property.</summary>
        public int MyInt{
            get{ return myInt; }
            set{ myInt = value;}
        }
        
        /// <summary>   
        /// Description of GetMyFloat.
        /// Returns: myFloat
        /// </summary>
        public float GetMyFloat(){
            return myFloat;
        }

        // Create a MyClass Object.
        public MyClass = new MyClass(6f, 5);   
    }
What if there is a line right below the code? Is this included in the code block? It should not be.
    
As you can see, even the text on the bottom has not been included in the code block, this is great. :D
